# Eat Da Yummy Burgers!

### Week 14 Homework
#### About This Homework

This app is a burger logger utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.
<br />

#### How it Works
The user inputs some delicious burgers and they are then added to a list. The user can then "devour" the burger which will move it to the "devoured" list. Once there, the user has the option to delete that (or any) burger on the devoured list.
